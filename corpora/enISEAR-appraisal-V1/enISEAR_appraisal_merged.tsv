Every day I'd come back from school desperately hoping it had arrived to another day of disappointment. When it finally arrived after lots of delays I felt a huge amount of intense ... and also excitement, it was one of the best warm feelings as an autistic child I could have felt, it was like all my Christmas's had come together in one, I couldn't wait to get it connected and only my parents forcing me to go to bed later that night forced me away from it or I would have stayed up all night and the ... of receiving it remained for a long time, this remained an obsession that never ended. It's probably difficult to understand how much ... I felt to receive such a basic computer by someone who doesn't have an addictive autistic interest like I did and still have, but I haven't stopped using computers every day since then and I'm now 49 years old.	3	2	1	3	0	0	1
